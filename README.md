Star Trek Hangman!

In this game, the user has to guess the hidden word by inputting characters one at a time. If they input 10 incorrect characters, the game is over, an image for losing shows up, and an explosion is sounded. If the word is correctly guessed, the "wins" score goes up by one, an image for the correctly guessed word appears, and a bosun whistle is sounded. If the user wins or loses, either way they can play again by clicking the "play again" button.

To Play:
1. Go to: https://pleasus.github.io/Hangman-Game/
2. Start typing letters.
3. Click "play again" button if you want to play again.
